This is an alternative Firmware for the Merkur AVR Alfa.
Since I was not happy with the one that comes with the product,
I add some new features, which are prety handy. 
Now for example, the speed of both motors can be controled in both direction.
The firmware as it is works as an example. When press forward, the software
incrise the speed for both motors slowly. By pressing backward, it decrement the speed,
until it drives back. By pressing Func. B it stops rightway.
